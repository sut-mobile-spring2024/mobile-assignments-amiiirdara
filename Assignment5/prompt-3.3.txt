Let's play a game of Tic-Tac-Toe (XO) on a 3x3 grid. Here's the current state of the board:

Current state of the board:
X | O | X
O | X | -
- | - | O

It's your turn to play as 'O'. Please determine the next move using the minimax algorithm with the following considerations:
1. If there is a move that wins the game for the CPU, take that move.
2. If the opponent has a move that would win the game on their next turn, block that move.
3. Otherwise, use the minimax algorithm to determine the best possible move to either maximize the CPU's chances of winning or minimize the player's chances of winning.
4. If the board is full and no player has won, the game is a draw.

Based on this algorithm, what is your next move? Please provide the row and column number (e.g., "move to row 2, column 3") and indicate if this move results in a win for 'X', 'O', or if the game continues.
